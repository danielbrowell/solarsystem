// We've written them out like this so you can see different things about them.
// We call this way of writing things out "Object Notation",
// because it is a nice way of making a note of objects.
// Each planet has a diameter in kilometers and an orbit in kilometers
// The planets are big, and really far apart.
// It would take you about 10 minutes to walk just 1 kilometer.
// Imagine how long it would take you to walk from the sun to where mercury orbits!



// This is our star, the sun.
var sun = { diameter: 1391900 };
// It has a diameter which you can get like this:
// stars.sun.diameter
// Have you noticed how much bigger it is than the planets?
// We're going to make all the planets orbit around it.



// π is a greek letter pronounced "Pie" (sounds yummy)

var π = Math.PI; 

// We use Pi to represent a special number 
// that you can use to find out the length around any circle,
// just by knowing the distance accross the circle.
// We call the length around a circle, the circumferance.
// The length across a circle, we call the diameter.
// We even have a name for half the length accross a circle (from the middle to the edge), 
// we call this the radius.
// We are going to use these things to help us draw circles and spheres like our planets.
